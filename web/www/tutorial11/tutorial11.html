<h1>Tutorial 11 - Concatenating Transformations</h1>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../ogldev-source.zip">Get the source!</a></span><br> </div>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In the last few tutorials we have developed several
transformations that give us the flexibility of moving an object
anywhere in the 3D world. We still have a couple more to learn (camera
control and perspective projection) but as you probably already
guessed, a combination of the transformation is required. In most cases
you will want to scale the object to fit your 3D world, rotate it into
the required orientation, move it somewhere, etc. Up till now we have
been exercising a single transformation at a time. In order to perform
the above series of transformations we need to multiply the first
transformation matrix by the vertex position and then multiple the next
transformation by the result of the previous multiplication. This goes
on until all the transformation matrices have been applied on the
vertex. One trivial way to do that is to supply each and every
transformation matrix to the shader and let it do all the
multiplications. This, however, is very inefficient since the matrices
are the same for all vertices and only vertex position changes.
Luckily, linear algebra provides a set of rules that make our life
easier. It tells us that given a set of matrices M<sub>0</sub>...M<sub>n</sub>
and a vector V the following holds true:<br><br>
M<sub>n </sub>* M<sub>n-1 </sub>* ...  * M<sub>0</sub> * V = (M<sub>n</sub>* M<sub>n-1 </sub>* ... * M<sub>0</sub>) * V<br><br>
So if you calculate:<br><br>
N = M<sub>n </sub>* M<sub>n-1 </sub>* ... * M<sub>0</sub><br><br>
Then:<br><br>
M<sub>n </sub>* M<sub>n-1 </sub>* ... * M<sub>0</sub> * V = N * V<br> <br></p>
<p>This means that we can calculate N once and then send it to the shader
as a uniform variable where it will be multiplied in each vertex. This
will require the GPU one matrix/vector multiplication per vertex.</p>
<p>How do you order the matrices when generating N? The first thing you
need to remember is that the vector is initially multiplied by the
matrix on the far right of the series (in our case - M<sub>0</sub>)<sub>.
</sub>Then the vector is transformed by each matrix as we travel from
the right hand side to the left hand side. In 3D graphics you usually
want to scale the object first, then rotate it, then translate it, then
apply camera transformation and finally project it to 2D. Let's see what happens
when you rotate first and then translate:</p>
<img style="width: 750px; height: 350px;" alt="" src="rot_trans.png">
<p>Now see what happens when you translate first and then rotate:</p>
<img style="width: 750px; height: 500px;" alt="" src="trans_rot.png">
<p>As you can see, it is very diffcult to set the object position in the
world when you translate it first because if you move it away from the
origin and then rotate it goes around the origin which actually means
that you translate it again. This second translation is something you
want to avoid. By rotating first and then translate you disconnect the
dependency between the two operations. This is why it is always best to
model around the origin as symmetrically as possible. That way when you
later scale or rotate there is no side effect and the rotated or scaled
object remains symmetrical as before.</p>
<p>Now that we are starting to handle more than one transformation in the
demos we have to drop the habit of updating the matrix directly in the
render function. This method doesn't scale well and is prone to errors.
Instead, the pipeline class is introduced. This class hides the fine
details of matrix manipulation under a simple API to change the
translation, rotation, etc. After setting all the parameters inside it
you simply extract the final matrix that combines all the
transformation. This matrix can be fed directly into the shader.</p>
<h2>Code Walkthru</h2>
<code>#define ToRadian(x) ((x) * M_PI / 180.0f)<br>
#define ToDegree(x) ((x) * 180.0f / M_PI)
</code>
<p>We are starting to use the actual values of angles in this tutorials.
As it happens, the trigonometric functions of the standard C library
take radian as a parameter. The above macros take the angle either in
radians or degrees and convert to the other notation.</p>
<code>
inline Matrix4f operator*(const Matrix4f&amp; Right) const<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matrix4f Ret;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for (unsigned int i = 0 ; i &lt; 4 ; i++) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for (unsigned int j = 0 ; j &lt; 4 ; j++) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ret.m[i][j] = m[i][0] * Right.m[0][j] +<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m[i][1] * Right.m[1][j] +<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m[i][2] * Right.m[2][j] +<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m[i][3] * Right.m[3][j];<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return Ret;<br>
}<br>
</code>
<p>This handy operator of the matrix class handles matrix multiplication.
As you can see, each entry in the resulting matrix is defined as the
dot product of its line in the left matrix with the column in the right
matrix. This operator is key in the implementation of the pipeline
class.</p>
<pre>
<code>
class Pipeline
{
	public:
		Pipeline()
		{ ...  }

		void Scale(float ScaleX, float ScaleY, float ScaleZ)
		{ ... }

		void WorldPos(float x, float y, float z)
		{ ... }

		void Rotate(float RotateX, float RotateY, float RotateZ)
		{ ... }

		const Matrix4f* GetTrans();
	private:
		Vector3f m_scale;
		Vector3f m_worldPos;
		Vector3f m_rotateInfo;
		Matrix4f m_transformation;
};
</code>
</pre>
<p>The pipeline class abstracts the details of getting all the
transformation required for one single object combined. There are
currently 3 private member vectors that store the scaling, position in
world space and rotation for each axis. In addition there are APIs to
set them and a function to get the matrix that represent the sum of all
these transformations.</p>
<pre>
<code>
const Matrix4f* Pipeline::GetTrans()
{
	Matrix4f ScaleTrans, RotateTrans, TranslationTrans;
	InitScaleTransform(ScaleTrans);
	InitRotateTransform(RotateTrans);
	InitTranslationTransform(TranslationTrans);
	m_transformation = TranslationTrans * RotateTrans * ScaleTrans;
	return &amp;m_transformation;
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>This function initializes three seperate matrices as the
transformations that match the current configuration. It multiplies
them one by one and returns the final product. Note that the order is
hard coded and follows the description above. If you need some
flexibility there you can use a bitmask that specifies the order. Also
note that it always stores the final transformation as a member. You
can try optimizing this function by checking a dirty flag and returning
the stored martix in the case that there was no change in configuration
since the last time this function was called.</p>
<p>This function uses private methods to generate the different
transformations according to what we've learned in the last few
tutorials. In the next tutorials this class will be extended to handle
camera control and perspective projection.</p>
<pre>
<code>
Pipeline p;
p.Scale(sinf(Scale * 0.1f), sinf(Scale * 0.1f), sinf(Scale * 0.1f));
p.WorldPos(sinf(Scale), 0.0f, 0.0f);
p.Rotate(sinf(Scale) * 90.0f, sinf(Scale) * 90.0f, sinf(Scale) * 90.0f);
glUniformMatrix4fv(gWorldLocation, 1, GL_TRUE, (const GLfloat*)p.GetTrans());
</code>
</pre>
<p>These are the changes to the render function. We allocate a pipeline
object, configure it and send the resulting transformation down to the
shader. Play with the parameters and see their effect on the final
image.</p>
